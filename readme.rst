Block Array Cow
###############

Introduction
============

In memory array de-duplication, useful for efficiently storing many versions of data.

This is suitable for storing undo history for example - where the size of a struct can be used as the stride,
and is effective with both binary and text data.

The code is Apache2.0 licensed and doesn't have any dependencies.


Algorithm
=========

This has a slight emphasis on performance, since this method is used in Blender's undo system.
Where making users of the application wait for an exhaustive method isn't acceptable.

- A new ``BArrayStore`` is created with a fixed stride and block size.
- Adding a new state to the array store simply divides the array into blocks and stores them.
- Adding another state can use any previous state as a reference, where its blocks will be re-used where possible.
- Matching blocks at the start/end of the array are checked and copied until s mismatch is found.
- If a mismatch is found, the reference blocks use a lazily initialized hash of their first *N* bytes.
  A hash data for the data being added with a value for each stride offset is calculated too.

  Looping over the newly added state data can now perform hash look-ups on the reference chunks
  and then a full comparison if a match is found.

  In that case the following chunks are tested to see if they match (to avoid further lookups),
  otherwise a new chunk is allocated.
- On completion the new state is added which may contain both new and reused chunks from previous states.


Where *N* is currently the ``stride * 7``, see: ``BCHUNK_HASH_TABLE_ACCUMULATE_STEPS``.


Supported
---------

- Caller defined block sizes.
- Caller defined array-stride to avoids overhead of detecting possible matches it un-aligned offsets.
  *(a stride of 1 for bytes works too)*
- De-duplication even in the case blocks are completely re-ordered
  *(block hashing is used for de-duplication)*.
- Each state only needs to reference its previous,
  making both linear and tree structures possible.
- Out of order adding/freeing states.


Unsupported
-----------

In general operations that would use excessive calculation are avoided,
since there are many possible changes that would improve memory usage at the cost of performance.

- Re-aligning of single-user reference block boundaries
  to reduce the size of duplicate blocks when changes are found.
- Detecting numeric changes to the data (values incremented/decremented, zeroed etc... are not detected).
- Reversing data.


Further Work
============

Some things that may be worth considering.

- It may be worth using ``mmap`` for data storage.
- Block compression
  *(likely based on caller defined rule about when a state's data isn't likely to be read again).*
